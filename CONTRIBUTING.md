## Coding Guidelines
To maintain a consistent codebase and ensure readability, we follow these coding guidelines:

- Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Write self-explanatory and properly documented code. Add comments where necessary to improve code understanding.
- Follow the appropriate coding style for the programming language used in the repository.
- Format your code consistently, paying attention to indentation, spacing, and line length.

Please familiarize yourself with the existing codebase and adhere to the established coding style to ensure code consistency.

## Commit Message Guidelines
When writing commit messages, please follow these guidelines:

- Write clear and descriptive commit messages that summarize the purpose of the commit concisely.
- Use the present tense and imperative mood in commit messages (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
